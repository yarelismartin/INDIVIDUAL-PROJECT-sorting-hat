Project Name: Sorting Hat 

Overview: In this project, I am building a Sorting Hat that allows users to enter their names to be selected for one of the houses. To begin, when users click the "Sort" button, a form will render for them to fill out their names and proceed with the sorting process. Once the form is submitted, filter buttons will appear, and the new students will be added to the class. Users can view students in different houses by using the filters and expel students as well.

List of features:
- event listener buttons
- render to DOM function 
- filter buttons 
- create and delete card
